# COMPUTER GRAPHICS - GEOMETRY DASH #

Self-interpretation of the basic concept of the arcade game Geometry Dash developed using Lazarus IDE. 
Written in Pascal, and uses the MPlayer external plugin to process sound-related output. Player controls the cube on a flat terrain, 
with randomly generated spikes, similar to Google Chrome's dinosaur game. All assets used in this game are independently created and 
owned by the respective repository owners.
